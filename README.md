# CHERTOY

This is an implementation of the CHERTOY system for the Word Sense Induction task (the Task 11 at SemEval 2013).
This project also contains an implementation of the baseline and 40 experiments with it.

We experiment with language models, specific features and clustering algorithms based on the sense2vec and the sent2vec systems. 
After having performed 40 carefully designed experiments we obtained interesting insights on the effects of several feature combinations which resulted in our WSI system CHERTOY.

The system creates semantic related clusters from the given snippets (the text fragments get back from the search engine) for each pre-defined ambiguous topic. 
It makes the preprocessing of the input data, creates a language model using vector representations for each snippet with sense2vec and vector misture model (BOW representation with summarization for each snippet) and creates semantic clusters with the Mean Shift clustering algorithm.

## RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS

Dependencies:
- sense2vec (paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06388, code: https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec)
- skikit-learn

### Input files:

The input data must consist of two text files: results.txt and topics.txt.

* results.txt

A file with snippets in the following format: 

ID \t url \t title \t snippet

There are no empty lines between the snippets.

_Example:_

ID \t url \t title \t snippet

1.1	\t http://www.polaroid.com/	\t Polaroid | Home | 74.208.163.206	Create and share like never before at <b>Polaroid</b>.com. Find instant film and   cameras reinvented for the digital age. Plus, digital cameras, digital camcorders,   LCD <b>...</b>

1.2	\t http://www.polaroid.com/products	\t products | www.polaroid.com	Come check out a listing of Polaroid products, by category.

1.3	\t http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaroid_ \t Corporation	Polaroid Corporation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia	<b>Polaroid</b> Corporation is an American-based international consumer electronics   and eyewear company, originally founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land. It is most <b>...</b>


* topics.txt

A file with ambiguous topics. The system will create clusters for each of these topics.

_Example:_

id	description

1	polaroid

2	kangaroo

3	shakira

4	kawasaki


### Output files:

CHERTOY produces the output file (output.txt) that is formatted as follows:

subTopicID \t resultID

Here the subTopicID consists of the topic ID from the file topicx.txt and the number of the cluster (meaning). 
The resultID is the ID number of the snippet from the file results.txt.

_Example:_

subTopicID \t resultID

45.0 \t 45.1

45.0 \t 45.10

45.1 \t 45.20

### Create a folder structure:

Create a folder with your projects:
* project folder
    * folder with your input files (resutls.txt and topics.txt)
 
After running the system you'll have the output file in your project folder.

### RUN THE SYSTEM:


git clone https://gitlab.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/semantik_project/wsi_chernenko_schindler_toyota.git

cd bin

python3 chertoy.py < path to the project folder > < /name of the folder with your input data > < /name of your topics.txt file > < /name of your results.txt file > < /name of the output file you want to create in the folder with the project > 

_Example:_

python3 chertoy.py /home/tatiana/Desktop/FSemantik_Projekt /test /topics.txt /results.txt /output_chertoy.txt


### Other files:

* Performances_Table.pdf - a performance table with F1, RI, ARI and JI values of the baseline and 40 experiments (incl. CHERTOY) on the trial data.

* bin

The folder contains the implementation of the CHERTOY system.

* experiments

The folder experiments contains an implementation of the baseline and 40 different experiments to improve its performance.

* lib

The folder contains code for preprocessing Wikipedia Dataset to train own sent2vec models for the experiments and a README file. Our preprocessed Wikipedia 2017 dataset and two self-trained models of the Wikipedia 2017 dataset, that we used in our experiments with sent2vec, are provided on /proj/toyota on the server of the Institut of Computerlinguistics Heidelberg.
Other models that we used during our experiments can be found in sense2vec and sent2vec repositories.

* experiments

Implementation of the baseline and 40 experiments with it.

* output

outputs\_trial_data - output files for the experiments on the trial data
output\_test\_data - output file for the test data
